# AutoClickTool
Tool to automate. Uses screen shots to determine where to click on the screen.

Basically you take screen shots of portions of the screen to tell the tool where to click later. Once you start the timer, anytime it sees those scren shots it clicks where you told it to. This makes automating flash games possible.
